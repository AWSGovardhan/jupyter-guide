# Guide for Reproducible Research and Data Science in Jupyter Notebooks

This guide is a community-resource of crowdsourced guidelines and tutorials for reproducible research in Jupyter Notebooks. This resource is a companion to the high-level guide [TenRulesJupyter](https://github.com/jupyter-guide/ten-rules-jupyter) and paper [Ten Simple Rules for Reproducible Research in Jupyter Notebook]() to keep up with the rapidly evolving Jupyter project and to provide in-depth tutorials and examples.

## How to Contribute

* Add specific chapters to this guide, e.g. Deploy your notebooks
* Flesh out or update materials 
* Explain details with code snippets or figures
* Demonstrate guidelines through example notebooks
* Organize content 
* Apply a Jekyll layout, similar to [Open Source Guides](https://github.com/github/opensource.guide)
* Anything else to strengthen the community of Jupyter Notebooks users 

For suggestions please open an [issue](https://github.com/jupyter-guide/jupyter-guide/issues). To contribute, fork this repository and send [pull-requests](https://github.com/jupyter-guide/jupyter-guide/pull/new/master).

## Guides and Tutorials

* [__Deploy your notebooks__](https://github.com/jupyter-guide/jupyter-guide/blob/master/deployment.md): How to share your notebooks

* [__Parameterize your notebooks__](https://github.com/jupyter-guide/jupyter-guide/blob/master/parameterize.md): How to pass in parameters to notebooks
* Other sections (to be written)


## Cookiecutters
[Cookiecutters](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) are project templates to create skeleton repositories for Python and other languages. Here are a couple of examples you may find useful.

* [__Template for general Python projects__](https://github.com/MolSSI/cookiecutter-cms)

* [__Template for Datascience projects__](http://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/)
