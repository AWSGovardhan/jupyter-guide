# jupyter-guide
Community guide for reproducible research and data science using Jupyter Notebook and Jupyter Lab.

This repo is a collection of crowdsourced tips and guidelines.

The inital content is based on a workshop: "Reproducible Research and Interactive Education - Application of Jupyter Notebooks" held at UC San Diego on April 5, 2018.

Please help refine and extend this guide. For example:

* Add or expand guidelines
* Add specific examples with code snippets or figures
* Demonstrate guidelines through example notebooks
* Organize content hierachically 
* Apply a Jekyll layout (similar to [Open Source Guides](https://github.com/github/opensource.guide)
* Anything else to strengthen the community of Jupyter Notebooks users 

To make edits, please open an [issue](https://github.com/sbl-sdsc/jupyter-guide/issues), fork this repository, and send pull-requests.
