# Guide for Reproducible Research and Data Science using Jupyter Notebook

This guide is a community-resource of crowdsourced tips and guidelines. 

## Content

* [__Basic Guidelines__](https://github.com/sbl-sdsc/jupyter-guide/blob/master/basic_guide.md): Follow these 7 simple rules
* [__Deploy your notebooks__](https://github.com/sbl-sdsc/jupyter-guide/blob/master/deployment.md): How to share your notebooks 
* Other sections (to be written)
